For this challenge you need to create a simple MIN / MAX statement that will return the Minimum and 
Maximum ages out of all the people.

people table schema

    id
    name
    age

select table schema

    age_min (minimum of ages)
    age_max (maximum of ages)

    NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.


------------------------
select min(age) as age_min, max(age) as age_max from people
------------------------
