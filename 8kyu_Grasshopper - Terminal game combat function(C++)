Create a combat function that takes the player's current health and the amount of damage recieved,
and returns the player's new health. Health can't be less than 0.



-----------------------------
int combat(int health, int damage){
  int new_health;
  new_health = health - damage;
  if(new_health < 0){
    return 0;
    }
  return(new_health);
}
