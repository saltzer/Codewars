Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

    S is misinterpreted as 5
    O is misinterpreted as 0
    I is misinterpreted as 1

The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.


-----------------------------
function correct($string) {
  $err1 = '5';
  $err2 = '0';
  $err3 = '1';
  $replace1 = 'S';
  $replace2 = 'O';
  $replace3 = 'I';
  $string = str_replace($err1, $replace1, $string);
  $string = str_replace($err2, $replace2, $string);
  return $string = str_replace($err3, $replace3, $string);
}
